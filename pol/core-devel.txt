The following features are in development - some parts work, some parts don't.

POL093-2000-01-26:
    Added performance counters to polcore() [these still need work]
        Number of Error objects are being created per minute:
            polcore().error_creations_per_min
        Task scheduler performance: mainly combat operations
            polcore().tasks_late_per_min
            poclore().tasks_ontime_per_min
        Script scheduler performance:
            polcore().scripts_late_per_min
            polcore().scripts_ontime_per_min

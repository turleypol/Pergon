Arena v2.0b
By: Sigismund

*** Introduction ***

Arena is a fully automated player combat system, designed with places
like the Jhelom Arena in mind.   It allows players to "sign up" and
fight monsters, or other players, in a controlled setting.



*** Operation ***

The arena object consists of two separate scripts, the registry, and
the actual arena control script.  When a player double-clicks the
arena registry stone, that player is added to a queue.  A maximum
of 7 players are allowed in the queue at one time, and a player may
not have more than one spot.  For player vs. player battles, it is
only necessary for one player to sign up.

The arena control script does all the rest of the work.  It will
perform a check every 30 seconds to see if there are any fighters
waiting in the queue.  If so, it will grab the first one, start the
fight routine, wait for the finish of the fight, and perform some
maintenance.   If there are no fighters in the queue, it goes
straight to the maintenance, then starts the loop again.



*** Installation ***

- Unzip this package in a directory off of /pol/pkg, and make sure
  it is enabled.

- Double check the arena object (default 0xA200) to make sure it is
  not in use by other shard objects.

- Set the arenaregistry.cfg file up to your specifications.  The
  file should be set as follows:


// FIXME: veraltet
arenavendor arena               // This is the name of the arena,
                                // set in the CProp "VendorID"
{
        TopX    1385            // These 6 lines set the bounds
        TopY    3729            // of the arena.   The default
        TopZ    -21             // values are the dimensions of
        BottX   1414            // the Jhelom arena.
        BottY   3758
        Bottz   -21
        DestX   1407            // These entries determine
        DestY   3733            // possible starting locations
        DestZ   -21             // for arena fighters.   When they
        DestX   1390            // start the battle, they are
        DestY   3751            // transported to a random location
        DestZ   -21             // from this list.
        DestX   1388
        DestY   3731
        DestZ   -21
        Monster orc2            // These are monster definitions,
        Level   2               // based on entries in npcdesc.cfg.
        Type    1               // "Level" is the difficulty level,
        Monster liche           // as chosen in the fight script,
        Level   5               // and "type" is the # of the
        Type    1               // battle as chosen in the fight
        Monster lizardman1      // script.  (1 = humanoid, 2=
        Level   2               // bestial, etc. etc.)
        Type    1
}

- MAKE SURE THE ARENA OBJECT IS *NOT* LOCATED IN THE ARENA!

Dye System - version .4
Created by Zulu Jan 10, 2000 - updated April 5, 2000

** version. 4 **
I have gotten rid of the cprop dye i1 part of this package. It uses too much memory and the new system is more powerful. There is now a dyeitems.cfg file where you add what items can be dyed. There is a sample file with most common items done.

the entry player # = what cmd level they need to dye the item.

item 0x1F03
{
player 0
}

0 = everyone
1 = counselor, seer, gm, admin
2 = seer, gm, admin
3 = gm, admin
4 = admin

** uninstalling **
If you installed version .3 then you will have to delete the cprop dye i1 entries in the itemdesc.cfg files that you added.

Load the items.txt, npcequip.txt, pcequip.txt, storage.txt and pcs.txt from the /pol/data file and delete the CProp dye i1 entries.  You can load each file and do a search for CProp dye i1 and erase that line.

** version. 3 ** 
I have made some adjustments on the scripts and I have included a new setprop command. Now only Admin's will be able to dye anything. GM's will be able to dye things that have the dye flag on.

It will allow players to dye "allowed" items and prevent all other items from being dyed. It allows Admin's to dye anything.

*************************
How to set up the script: 
*************************
Copy the dyecheck.src to the \pol\scripts\items directory.
Copy the dyecheck.cfg to the \pol\config\ directory.
Copy the setprop.ecl to the \pol\scripts\textcmd\gm directory.

Load the itemdesc.txt in the \pol\config\ directory. Find the following entry:

Item 0x0FAB
{
Name dyetub
VendorSellsFor 20
}

Change it to the following:

Item 0x0FAB
{
Name dyetub
VendorSellsFor 20
script dyecheck
}

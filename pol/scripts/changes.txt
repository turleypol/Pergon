General Script Changes
---------------------------
2/17/2000, Dundee	* Added Questie npcs for "Bob the wanderer in Yew has a vase for me.  If you bring 
			  it I will pay you" and "I have a vase for Joe the drunkard in Vesper.  if you [take]
			  it to him, he will pay you."  Questitems.cfg defines things for them to want delivered.

				Update to speech.inc makes it so handing the questitem to any speaking npc
				will prompt them to tell you who you are looking for, and what direction they
				are in.

			* Made DW's doppelgangers use the same ai\main ai\combat sort of structure (todo: make an
			  ai\setup?).

			* Added .news seer command and town criers that read the news to players.  Usage of the
			  textcmd is ".news read", ".news write" or ".news delete".

			
1/28/2000, Dundee	* Added "dressme.src" to misc\ and is now called from ai\main\setup.inc to dress npcs.
				specify dress style in npcdesc.cfg
			* Added "colorrange" in npcdesc and ai\main\setup.inc update for randomly colored mobs
			* Added seer command ".openpack" to view what mobs are carrying.
			* Updated playervendors (some general fixes there).
			* Updated AI's.
				Added explosionkillpcs (for marksmen) and explosion.src to alchemy\
				Marksmen npcs now chuck purplepotions at their opponents (while shooting bolts)
				Added poisonkillpcs for snakes and serpents
				Added animal.src and mainloopanimal for animal noises, nospeech, no looting.
			* Added dunlockpicking as optional lockpicking pkg, use with .spawnschest textcmd\seer
			* Added regionspawner as optional package.  Current cfg stocks entire world (pretty much).
				.cr and .depop are added for use with regionspawner in textcmd\gm.
			* Probably screwed something up trying to commit this much junk at once.
			* Fixed .makemagic to prompt for info and not require setting a bunch of cprops manually.
			* keyitem and keyword now allow you to specify a word or an item to which the npc
			  should bark a response, as well as an item they should give when their keyword or keyitem
			  is heard/received.  To use with an npc: The npc must use speech.inc.  CheckSpeech which 
			  is heard and TakeItems on EVID_ITEMGIVEN.  See healer, helppcs, goodcaster, etc.
			* keyword 'hi' sets up a default greeting which they will bark in response to hearing
			  anything that isn't a keyword itself.

12/7/99, Dundee         * Added '.dress' seer command to dress npcs.
                          Need to move the code to an .inc and use for person/townie/etc. ai's.
                          .dress rich
                          .dress poor
                          .dress warrior
                          .dress mage
                          Makes some neat looking npcs.  Works on players, too.

12/6/99, Dundee         * Added 'guard' command to pets.  Made them follow faster.
11/15/99, Dundee	* More changes to spell damage amounts.  Now they are PERFECT.  *kaf*
			* fixed an exploit with magic reflect
			* fixed summoning-spells and nightsight for charged magic items
			* fixed inscription's making of charged magic items
			* added charged magic items ":magic:magicitems" script and 
			  .makemagic seer command.  See changes.txt in pkg/std/magic for details.
			* added .maketele command and items/makedtele script, see textcmd/seer/maketele
			  for the item that MUST be added to itemdesc.cfg.
			* made door.src look for the key on the user or in a keyring on the user
			  if the door is locked.

11/01/99, Dundee	* .keyword was case sensitive, now it isn't.
			* .grab and looting npcs wont scalp corpses any more.

			  of logs, or moves.
			* Fixed blacksmithing without consuming ingots exploit.
			* tweaked allowed taming attempt range
 
10/25/99, Dundee, 	* Replaced the elusive runaway script problem with an elusive brain-
			  dead/full event que problem.
			* Put in npc looting - if "cprop looter 1" is set on the npc.
			* Made npcs hyper, and they help each other out by sending enteredarea 
			  events to each other when engaged.
			* Made npcs sleep when no players are around.
			* doppel ai types change shape again.
			* Taming: cannot tame others pets, or attempt to tame beyond your ability.
			* Bladed: Fixed carving kindling from trees and fishsteaks from stacked
			  fish.
			* Inscription: Fixed the point values, put in mana cost, auto spellbook
			  search and looping to "begin scribing" a whole stack of scrolls, and quit
			  when you run out of mana, scrolls or you move.
			* Mining and smelting:  Put an autosearch for a nearby forge in smelting.
			  Made mining repeat until you either move, something happens, or you run out
			  of ore.  "Something happens" is similar to fishing.
			* Lumberjacking: Must equip the axe, cannot chop-n-run and made the script
			  repeat until you either move or the tree runs out of wood.  If there's no
			  wood, you get a message before you start chopping.
			* Added keyword/bark-response to speech.inc and .keyword seer command.
			  Usage is:

				.keyword WORD

			  You're prompted to enter the npc's response to WORD.  Any time the npc hears
			  WORD after that, he barks the response.  .keyword WORD again will shut him up.
			  Only works on npcs that include speech.inc - and most aggressive types do not
			  now (they never chat much anyway).
			* Added .frozen cprop to .freeze/thaw commands and a check on npc scripts so
			  that if they were frozen at shutdown, the re-freeze when the server comes
			  back up.
			* Changed-n-added key/lock commands:

				.rekey - now generates a new lockid for the target and creates a key
					to match it.
				.makekey - creates a key to match any item you target, if it has a lockid.
				.relock - changes the lockid of any door/container to match the key you
					specify.
			* added .itemwipe text command to admin\.  Usage is: 

				.itemwipe x y r

			  where x and y are the tile coordinates of ground zero and r is the blastradius.

Package System
==============

Packages sit in /pol/pkg/[dir]

pol/pkg/[dir]/pkg.cfg is the package configuration file.

Subdirectories can contain packages, too.  If a directory under pol/pkg has
no pkg.cfg, or has a pkg.cfg and is enabled, subdirectories will be searched.

The following can be defined in PKG.CFG (see also pkg/template/pkg.cfg)
    Enabled 0/1     if false, package is totally ignored
    Name            The package name
    Version         The package version
    Requires        zero or more required packages (one per line)
    Conflicts       zero or more conflicting packages (one per line)

The following special files can exist in a package directory:

    pkg.cfg         package descriptor file
    itemdesc.cfg    item descriptor entries for items 
    skills.cfg      skills defined in this package
    spells.cfg      spells defined in this package
    start.ecl       script to be run on system startup
    (to be done:)
    docs/           documentation directory.  Should contain index.htm
                    for automatic support through web server

Special notes for package itemdesc.cfg files
--------------------------------------------
    scripts specified in itemdesc.cfg are assumed to exist in the package's
    main directory. 

Script/Config File Descriptors
------------------------------
    Wherever script names are specified a full ":pkgname:scriptname" format
    can be used, to refer to a script in another package.
    item.usescript variables should always use full :pkgname:script format.

Config Files and Packages
-------------------------
    ReadConfigFile(cfgfilename) now accepts several forms of config filename:
    "cfgname"  
        - for a script not in a package, looks for pol/config/[cfgname].cfg
        - for a script in a package, looks for [pkgdir]/[cfgname].cfg
    ":pkgname:cfgname"
        - looks for [pkgdir]/[cfgname].cfg
    "::cfgname"
        - always looks in pol/config/[cfgname].cfg

Composite Config Files
----------------------
    "pol/config/itemdesc.cfg" used to contain all the item descriptors.  These
     are now spread out in multiple packages.  ReadConfigFile( "::itemdesc" )
     will access a special "composite" config file, which contains all
     elements found in all itemdesc.cfg files.
     The same goes for skills.cfg and spells.cfg


todo / ideas
============
    package 'tips' directory
    circles.cfg
    allow -any- file to be specified as a composite
      (would allow packages to provide hooks to support other packages)

problem areas
=============
    text commands
    object type ranges

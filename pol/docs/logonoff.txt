Logon/Logoff
============
    scripts/misc/logon.src is the login script.  It is executed when a 
    character that is not currently in the game world is selected by
    a player.
    scripts/misc/reconnect.src is the reconnect script.  Is it executed
    when a character that is currently in the game world is reselected by
    a player after a disconnect.
    scripts/misc/logoff.src is the logoff script.  It is executed just before
    actually removing the character from the game world.

    The sequence of events is:
        1. (Logged Out)
        2. Select character.
        3. Character moved to game world.
        3. scripts/misc/logon.src runs.
        4. Character in game world.
        5. Client disconnects.
        6. scripts/misc/logofftest.src runs
        7. Wait until timeout
        8. on timeout:
              run scripts/misc/logoff.src
              remove character from game world.
              back to (1)
           on log back in:
              run scripts/misc/reconnect.src
              back to (4)
    
    The logon, logoff, and reconnect scripts all look like this:
        program whatever( character )
            // do stuff with character
        endprogram
    They are all run to completion.
    Their return value is ignored.

  
Delayed Logout
==============
    scripts/misc/logofftest.src is executed when a client disconnects to 
    determine how long a character must wait to log off.  
    
    Here is a simple logofftest script:

        program logofftest( character )
            if (character.cmdlevel)
                return 0;           // GMs get to log off immediately.
            else
                return 5 * 60;      // Regular players have to wait 5 minutes.
            endif
        endprogram;


    The logofftest script is run to completion.  It must return the number of
    seconds until the character should be removed from the game world.  If it
    returns zero, the character will be removed from the game world immediately.

    The timeout counter starts from the last time the client sent a meaningful
    packet to the server, so if a player

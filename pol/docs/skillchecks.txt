POL players see their stats and skills on a scale of 0 - 100. However, the POL core sees them differently -- they're on a scale of 0 to 1000000 (or so). The translation between those scales allows for a difficulty curve that slows down stat and skill gain. The "raw" skill vlaue is on the internal (larger) scale, and the "base" value is on the 1-100 scale.For example, a skill of 10 base points (that is, it shows up as 10 on the paperdoll) is 2048 raw points (seen internally by POL)


Whenever a stat (or skill, of course. I'll just use stat for the rest of this document) is checked, there's a chance of success in the check, as well as a point value. The point value is the maximum number of raw skill points that will be added to the skill on success. This amount is modified by difficulty, and you will gain no points for something 20 points too easy for you.

For example, let's say that someone with 20 base (4096 raw) skill points succeeds with  the following skill check:
CheckSkill(character, SKILLID_SOMETHING, 20, 410);
That is, SKILLID_SOMETHING is checked at 20 difficulty, and success will get a maximum of 410 points (that's a lot). Since it's successful (and at the maximum difficulty for the character) he'll get the full 410 points. THat pushes him up to 4505 raw skill points, which equates to a 21 base skill score. In other words, he just gained a full point in the skill.

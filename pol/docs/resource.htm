<h1>Resource System</h1>

<p>There are two parts to the resource system.&nbsp; The first keeps you from harvesting
the same tree forever, and the second tracks resource usage and availability across
regions.</p>

<h2>Local Resource Depletion</h2>

<p>When a resource is harvested from a location, that resource is marked as
&quot;depleted.&quot;&nbsp; A tree may hold 50 units of wood.&nbsp; If 10 logs are
harvested from it, it will then hold only 40 units of wood until resource regeneration
occurs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Resource regeneration occurs at regular intervals, and returns a portion of depleted
resources to the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The &quot;difficulty&quot; of harvesting a given resource is inversely related to the
depletion level of that resource.&nbsp; Difficulties range from 10 (at 0% depletion) to 90
(at 100% depletion).&nbsp; Note that at 100% depletion, nothing can be harvested.
&nbsp; This difficulty is used as a guide; actual difficulty will range from 0 to 2 times
this difficulty.&nbsp; In this way, unskilled lumberjacks can eventually harvest wood from
a heavily deforested area; it will just take them longer, on average.&nbsp; It is never
impossibly for anyone to harvest from a given area, unless that area is totally depleted.</p>

<h2>Resource Pools (not yet implemented)</h2>

<p>The second level of resource management is resource pools.&nbsp; The map is divided
into regions, which define resource availability of the various types.&nbsp; As resources
are harvested from a given region, its resource level will drop.&nbsp; As this resource
level drops, the implicit &quot;depletion level&quot; of the region increases.&nbsp; If a
region's resource level is at 25%, every source of resources within it will be considered
to be at a 75% depletion level, for example.</p>

<p>As items are destroyed, resources will be returned to the these regional resource
pools.</p>

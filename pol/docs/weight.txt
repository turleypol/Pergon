weight and carrying capacity
============================
    Character weight is 10 stones always
    Maximum weight is Strength * 3.5 + 40
    Carrying capacity is maximum weight - character weight

stamina
=======
[numbers arbitrary]
    a person w/ 50 dex should be able to walk, carrying 50% of their carrying
      capacity, forever
    a person w/ 25 dex should be able to walk carrying 25% of their carrying
      capacity, forever.
        - so at 50% of carrying capacity, movement at the normal 
        movement rate should cost exactly the 

Some measurements
=================
    walk rate is 150 tiles per minute
    run rate is 300 tiles per minute
    150 tiles per minute is 2.5 tiles per second, or  0.40 seconds per tile
    300 tiles per minute is 5 tiles per second, or 0.20 seconds per tile
    regeneration for a 50-dex person standing still should be 1 per 5 seconds
    in this 5 seconds, they can walk 5*2.5=12.5 steps
    therefore walking 12.5 steps unencumbered should cost 1 stamina
    therefore each step should cost 0.08 stamina

    since when running, move-packets are sent faster, running automatically
      costs double what walking costs.

Getting Started with Scripting
==============================

1. Set up your Environment
   in \pol\scripts, there is a file named 'devenv.bat'.  Edit this file.
   Change the 'POL_ROOT' directory to your POL root, for example C:\POL

2. Edit POL.CFG to make script development more convenient
   in POL.CFG, Set CacheInteractiveScripts=0

3. Edit the script
   In your favorite text editor, pick a script and edit it.

4. Compile the script with 'ecompile'
      c:\pol\scripts> cd textcmd\seer
      c:\pol\scripts\textcmd\seer> ecompile where.src

5. Run the script
   In POL, type ".where"
